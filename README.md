# React + TypeScript + Vite + Redux + ReduxSaga + Sass

## Running the Project
To run your React application in development mode, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the Vite development server and enable Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a smooth development experience.


## Building the Project
To build your application for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command will create an optimized build of your application in the dist directory.

## Previewing the Build
After building, you can preview the production build by running:

```bash
npm run preview
```
This will serve the files in the dist directory, allowing you to see how your application will behave in a production environment.
